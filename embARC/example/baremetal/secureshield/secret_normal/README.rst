SecureShield Secret Normal
##########################

Overview
********

This example is embARC Secureshield secret normal example.

Detailed Description
====================

 * Extra Required Tools
    NO

 * Extra Required Peripherals
    NO

 * Design Concept
    This example is designed to show how data could be protected with SecureShield. The application demonstrates a secure keystore component. It's similar to the 'secret' example, but protects the secrets differently:
        - all containers are normal containers, no secure privileges.
        - to initialize the secret data in container 1, a private const data section is used; others cannot access this data. In an application with secure persistent storage like EEPROM or flash, it would be stored there.
        - a shared memory region is created for container 1 and container 2 to exchange data; others cannot access this region.
        - an application specific linker script is created to show how shared memory is created and how the initialization data is protected.
        - for further information on the application, see the 'secret' application

 * Usage Manual
    When this example start to run, please try the following ntshell commands:
    	- Run ntshell command `main -h` to see how to run this example.
    	- Run ntshell command `main -p embarc` or `main -t` to get the secret.

 * Extra Comments
 	NO
