/* Function: io_adc_read
 * Initiate acquisition of samples from a series of ADC inputs specified by IO_ADC_SET_SEQ_TABLE
 * control command. In case the ADC is configured to operate in repetitive mode then subsequent calls do not change hardware status,
 * but are expected to provide data buffers to store acquired samples. It is up to application to issue subsequent io_adc_read calls
 * promptly in this case. Failure to do that causes overflow condition and callback function registered by IO_SET_CB_ERR is called
 * from ISR with ADC instance identifier as its argument. Upon successful acquisition of specified number of samples the callback
 * function registered by IO_SET_CB_RX command is called with address of ready buffer passed as its argument.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   dev_id [In]   Identifier of ADC device instance.
 *   data [In]     Address of input buffer where requested number of acquired samples shall be stored
 *   size [In/Out] Address of variable that holds input buffer size specifying the number of samples to be acquired.
 *                 On invocation of callback, registerd by IO_SET_CB_RX command, the address contains the number
 *                 of samples actually acquired.
 * Returns:
 *   none
