OpenThread
##########

OpenThread is an open-source implementation of the Thread networking protocol.
Nest has released OpenThread to make the technology used in Nest products more
broadly available to developers to accelerate the development of products for
the connected home.

The Thread specification defines an IPv6-based reliable, secure and low-power
wireless device-to-device communication protocol for home applications. More
information about Thread can be found on threadgroup.org.

- Highly portable: OS and platform agnostic with a radio abstraction layer
- Implements the End Device, Router, Leader and Border Router roles
- Small memory footprint

OpenThread implements all Thread networking layers including IPv6, 6LoWPAN,
IEEE 802.15.4 with MAC security, Mesh Link Establishment, and Mesh Routing.
