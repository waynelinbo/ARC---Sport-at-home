CoAP
####

Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a software protocol intended to be
used in very simple electronic devices and allows them to communicate
interactively over the Internet. It is particularly targeted at small low-
power sensors, switches, valves, and similar components that need to be
controlled or supervised remotely, through standard Internet connections. CoAP
is an application layer protocol that is intended for use in resource-
constrained Internet devices.

Sources from the libcoap project are used to provide CoAP functionality in
FreeRTOS.
