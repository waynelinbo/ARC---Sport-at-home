MQTT
####

Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a machine-to-machine
(M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an
extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for
connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required
and/or network bandwidth is at a premium.

Sources from the Paho project are used to provide MQTT functionality in
FreeRTOS.
