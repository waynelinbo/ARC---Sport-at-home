LwM2M
#####

Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) defines the application-layer communication protocol
between a LwM2M Server and a LwM2M Client, which is located in a LwM2M Device.
The target LwM2M devices are mainly resource-constrained devices. It provides
a choice for M2M service providers to deploy a M2M system to provide service
to M2M users. It is frequently used with CoAP.

Sources from the Eclipse Wakaama project are used to provide LwM2M
functionality in FreeRTOS.
