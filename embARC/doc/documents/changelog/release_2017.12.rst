Known Issues
############

* This release has changed a lot in device layer, with the peripheral layer introduced, many examples which rely on old peripheral drivers in emsk will not be compatible with new embARC OSP, please modify it.
* Make version >=4.0 is not supported. Please use make version 3.81 or 3.82
* For Wifi applications, the Digilent pmod Wifi with Microchip part MRF24WG0MA should be used. Pmods built with MRF24WB0MA have been shown to experience problems and are NOT supported.
* Please don't put embARC source code too deep in your directory, because some examples can't be compiled due to too long command line not supported in Windows.
* Since brand new device hal API is upgraded, your application that use the old device hal API need to be upgraded.
* Secureshield library need MPU hardware module on EMSK, check your hardware configuration of EMSK before using it.
* Please use the recommended tool versions for metaware and arc gnu.
* For ARC GNU, an utility called **tcftool** from Metaware toolset is required for tcf build support. You can get it from Metaware Lite and copy it to ARC GNU's folder such as *C:/arc_gnu/bin/*.
